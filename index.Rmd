# **Some Good Movies**

I plan to write ideas on tech trends, not news. Think Stratechery by Ben Thompson but with less words.

## The Writing Begins Below

1. I first want to begin with a formal warning. Although I will try my best to be factualy acurate in everything that I am writing, including baseing my opinions in some form of realm rooted in truth, I tend to belive these writing may go off the rails and enter a more comedic based approach. One in which I know at best 10% of the knoledge I would need to make any claim whatsover, yet proceed to spill my opinions and be super confidence in the things I have no reason to be an expert on. Stay tuned for how things will unfold.
